# ClimateChangePrediction
THE ML MODEL PREDICTS THE AVERAGE GLOBAL TEMPRATURES IN THE NEAR 10/20/50 OR EVEN 100S OF YEARS

#About
THERES IS INCREASING RISE IN GLOBAL TEMPRATURE DUE TO VARIOUS CONDITIONS AND NATURAL FACTORS 

#PURPOSE
THIS MODEL HELPS IN PREDICTING THE AVERAGE GLOBAL TEMPRATURE AT ANY GIVEN YEAR

#SOLUTION
USES SUPERVISED LEARNING (LINEAR REGRESSION USED) FOR PREDICTING THE AVERAGE GLOBAL TEMPRATURE AT A GIVEN YEAR
